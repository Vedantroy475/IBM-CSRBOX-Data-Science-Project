# IBM CSRBOX Data Science Project

## Overview

This repository contains the project files for my micro internship in Data Science, completed with IBM SkillsBuild and CSRBOX from February 20, 2024, to March 5, 2024. The project involved analyzing health-related data using R programming to derive insights related to various health metrics.

## Project Objectives

- To analyze a dataset containing information about individuals' health metrics, including weight, blood pressure (bp), locality, smoking status, and tumor size.
- To identify patterns and correlations within the data that could inform health-related decisions.

## Files Included

- **IBM CSRBOX Data Science Project - 1.R**: This R script contains the initial data analysis and visualization steps.
- **IBM CSRBOX Data Science Project - 2.R**: This R script includes further analysis and modeling based on the insights gained from the first script.
- **Vedant Roy IBM Micro Internship Data Science Assignment.pdf**: This pdf document outlines the project objectives, methodology, and findings, providing a comprehensive overview of the work completed during the internship.
- **Vedant Roy IBM SkillsBuild Data Science Micro Internship Completion Certificate.pdf**: This file contains the completion certificate for the micro internship, validating the skills and knowledge acquired during the program.

## Technologies Used

- R Programming
- Data Analysis and Visualization

## Key Findings

The analysis explores the relationship between weight, blood pressure, locality, and smoking status, providing insights into potential health risks associated with these factors. The findings can be useful for health professionals and researchers in understanding how these variables interact.

## Getting Started

To run the R scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have R and RStudio installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
